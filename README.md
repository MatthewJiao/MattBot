This is a chatbot that I built using Tensorflow (in Python of course!). 2 hidden layers (8 neurons each| n_epoch=1000| batch_size=8). I've attached the JSON file with my personal input. Feel free to play around with it or add your own tweaks. At the moment, I'm trying to pull Reddit comments to build a new data set.
